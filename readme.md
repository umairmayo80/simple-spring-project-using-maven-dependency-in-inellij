# Spring Maven Project - Employee Management

This is a simple Spring Maven project that demonstrates employee management using the Spring framework. It showcases the concepts of Inversion of Control (IOC) and Dependency Injection (DI) provided by Spring.

## Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

- `src/main/java/com/umair/spring`: Contains the Java source code for the project.
- `src/main/resources`: Contains the XML configuration file `employeebean.xml`.
- `pom.xml`: Maven configuration file specifying project dependencies.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have the following:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- Apache Maven installed

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the project source code.
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or your preferred Java IDE.
3. Build the project using Maven to download dependencies.
4. Modify the `employeebean.xml` configuration file located in the `src/main/resources` directory to define employees.
5. Run the `Main` class located in `src/main/java/com/umair/spring` to execute the program.

## Functionality
